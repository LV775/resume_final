    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I have been working since I was 15 within the same company gaining valuable experience in 
        managing individuls, working within a management team, as well as being in charge of a team
        of people. Other responsibilities include managing labor costs, delegating various job duties,
        ensuring that operations are in compliance to saftey standards, and maximizing productivity 
        and efficiency. I have 65 hours of flight time as well as 220 landings which has allowed me 
        to learn various flight techniques and gain experience following ATC orders. This experience
        will be beneficial in aircraft dispatch because I understand the limitations and minimums of
        flying a plane. With being a shift manager comes the experience of working within a management
        team efficiently, being able to problem solve and manage other people.
